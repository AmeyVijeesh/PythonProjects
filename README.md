# Python Projects
Interesting and easy python projects. You can view a number of Python Projects from various modules like PyQt5, Pygame etc.
Each of the programs are tested and reviewed before adding it to my repository.
Some of my programs have used graphic user interface (GUI) while some do not. 

# How to install them?

You can use python package index (pip) to install the modules used in www.pypi.org

Modules used:

PyQt5- use pip for installation

Pygame

Tkinter- builtin

...and many more!

Note that some more minor modules used.

If you encounter any issues, just contact me.

I hope the code is easy to understand and... Enjoy!

Shortly, I will be adding more code. Stay tuned!
