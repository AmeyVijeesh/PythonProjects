Interesting and easy python projects. You can view a number of Python Projects from various modules like PyQt5, Pygame etc.
Each of the programs are tested and reviewed before adding it to my repository.
Some of my programs have used graphic user interface (GUI) while some do not. 

You can use python package index (pip) to install the modules used in www.pypi.org

Pygame - https://github.com/AmeyVijeesh/PythonProjects/tree/main/pygame

I hope the code is easy to understand and... Enjoy!

Shortly, I will be adding more code. Stay tuned!
